	<h2> LOLA COLA </h2>
	<p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
	<p>My name is Oluwadamilola but my friends call me Lola. This is my final year as an ITM major. I'm thinking about specializing in either software development or system engineering. I'm into photography, social media and hanging out with friends. I’m looking forward to so much in this class. I’ve been developing web pages since I was 12 on a site called IMVU, I was also using Photoshop and gimp to design the pages. I haven’t developed a page in a few years but I know that with a little review, I’ll be back running. </p>
